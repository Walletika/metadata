SERVICES

Walletika is a non-custodial wallet software, for digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, virtual commodities and NFTs (“Digital Assets”), meaning you are solely in control of and responsible for your Digital Assets, private keys and passwords, and accordingly you can authorize transactions from your wallet address. You expressly acknowledge and agree that as Walletika is a non-custodial wallet software, you are solely responsible for your activity and any risk of loss at all times.

Walletika allows you to:

1- generate wallet addresses and associated passwords that you may use to send and receive digital assets.
2- add a custom token created by other users or organizations.
3- add a custom network created by other users or organizations.
4- stake certain digital assets in a third party ‘proof of stake’ network through staking services.
5- view digital asset price information made available by third party service provider(s).
6- broadcast Digital Asset Transaction data to various blockchains supported by Walletika without requiring you to download or install the associated blockchain-based software to your local device.


Wallet Address, Passwords and Backup Capabilities

An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on user eligible devices. The username, password, and security password associated with the wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Digital Assets to and from that wallet address. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of username, password, security password, private key and OTP key associated with your wallet. It is very important to backup your wallets and keep your wallet access information such as username, password and security password in a safe place. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Digital Assets associated with your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store any passwords, private key or OTP key associated with your wallet. We cannot recover password of your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such wallet address will become inaccessible. Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your wallet username, password and security password information secure.


Digital Asset Transactions

In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and recorded in the Digital Asset’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Walletika, you acknowledge and agree that:
1- we do not have the ability to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction.
2- the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks.
3- we do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets.
4- any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us and therefore we do not guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.


Use of Staking Service

If you access or use the Staking Service, a third party may stake certain Digital Assets on your behalf (“Staked Digital Assets”), acting as a transaction validator on the applicable blockchain network. If a block of transactions is successfully validated using such Staked Digital Assets, a reward is granted by that network (“Staking Reward”).
You acknowledge and agree that Walletika is not responsible for:
1- your use of the Staking Service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of the Staking Service.
2- ensuring Staking will occur on a continuous basis.


Accuracy of Information Provided by User

You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Digital Asset.


WALLET REGISTRATION AND SECURITY

You must either import or create a wallet in order to use Walletika. When you create a wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your private key or any other breach of security of your wallet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all risks related to the use of the Services and you shall be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the password, security password, private key and OTP key of your wallet. When you create a wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following:
1- creating a strong unique password that you do not use for any other purpose (i.e. different to your phone password or any other passwords you use for websites, online services, etc.) and leveraging biometric authentication if available.
2- do not store the passwords or private key in plain text online or in an unsecured physical location.
3- limiting access to your devices and your wallet.
4- taking all necessary precautions against malware on your devices and networks.
5- promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your wallet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with activities that occur on your wallet with or without your authorization.


Transaction Fees
There may be transaction fees (e.g. mining fees) associated with your virtual currency transactions that are required by the virtual currency system or blockchain network that you engage with. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet and/or “gas” to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions or losses you incur due to incorrectly set transaction fees (i.e. too low or too high) or due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your wallet address. You further acknowledge and agree that we do not have access to your or anyone else’s transactions.

Taxes
It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Digital Asset-related transactions.
